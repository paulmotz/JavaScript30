    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let x = 0;
    // let y = x;
    // console.log(x, y);

    // x = 1;
    // console.log(x, y);

    // let a = "Hi";
    // let b = a;
    // console.log(a, b);

    // a = "Bye";
    // console.log(a, b);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players[0] = 'Paul';
    // console.log(players, team);
    // console.log(players[0] === team[0]);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    players[0] = 'PJM';
    // console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4, team5);;

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Paul',
        age: 26
    }    

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 28;

    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 28});
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
