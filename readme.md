# JavaScript30

These are my implementations of Wes Bos' [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com) challenge. In most cases, I added a feature of my own.

# Notes on my implementations

## 1 - JavaScrupt Drum Kit

Users can click to play a certain sound rather than just using the keyboard.

Playback of sounds doesn't reset current playback in Safari.

## 2 - JS + CSS Clock

I made every hand on the clock look unique. I also fixed a bug in the version of the code that I forked.

## 3 - CSS Variables

No changes (yet).

Safari does not support a pretty color picker

## 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

No changes since this was just a test of some array methods.

## 5 - Flex Panel Gallery

No changes (yet).

## 6 - Type Ahead

No changes (yet).

Does not work in Safari since it does not support fetch.

## 7 - Array Cardio Day 2

No changes since this was just a test of some array methods.

## 8 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas

I changed the color range and line width. TODO: I plan on allowing the user to do this using CSS variables.

## 9 - Dev Tools Domination

No changes as this was an instructional step.

## 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

I fixed what I consider to be a bug where if a user checks and unchecks a box it is still considered to be checked for the purpose of shift clicking.

An example of the "buggy" behavior:
-There are 9 checkboxes
-A user checks then unchecks the first box
-A user shift clicks the fifth box
-Boxes 1-4 which were unchecked are now all checked.

## 11 - Custom Video Player

TODO: I plan on adding a full screen button

My implementation allows multiple words and adds some *fabulous* details
