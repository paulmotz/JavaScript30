# JavaScript30

These are my implementations of Wes Bos' [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com) challenge. In most cases, I added a feature of my own.

# Notes on my implementations

## 1 - JavaScrupt Drum Kit

Users can click to play a certain sound rather than just using the keyboard.

## 2 - JS + CSS Clock

I made every hand on the clock look unique. I also fixed a bug in the version of the code that I forked.

## 3 - CSS Variables

No changes (yet).

## 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

No changes since this was just a test of some array methods.
